# 404-Error-Pages
A 404 error page keeps a visitor on your site even if he/she hits a page that doesn't exist. 
Also to change the bad User experience to a positive one by adding some links to that 404 page so that the visitor can navigate to some other page.
Instead of closing the window or navigating away from your site, the user is able to find helpful and potentially relevant resources on another page.
